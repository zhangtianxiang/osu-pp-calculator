# osu-pp-calculator

An osu! difficulty and pp calculator tool write in c++. First to implement the calculator of CTB mode.

Hello, everyone!

I'm trying to write an osu! difficulty and pp calulator in c++.

I will write a framework for all four mode, but first implement calculator for CTB, because I'm a CTB player and other modes' calculator already implemented.

Because the project is not so large, the whole project will not use something like cmake.

Using std=c++14.

Good luck to me.
